TODO:
1) Fix the comments / tooltips for the PlayerBoat script (such as the boatColliderHitBox variable / tooltip: could be related to the BoatCaptureHitBox script)
2) Check what the BoatCapureHitBoxScript is used for; only includes a var for playerBoat (could be merged into the PlayerBoat script)
3) In the CapturePoint script, when the capture point becomes neutral, remove all flags and set both teams to not have the capture point (right after line 162)
4) Check if changing the variables visibility caused any issues (PlayerBoat script, CapturePoint script)
5) Changed how the CreateBoatButton script works; check if anything broke (Ex: the spawn boat ui button's event getting removed)
6) Changed moneyDelayTimerStart from public to private in GameManager (line 57) check if this caused any issues

ONCE EVERYTHING HAS BEEN CHECKED:
1) Use control+f to check through all of the script files and remove all of the "FIX LATER" or "CHECK LATER" comments / issues
